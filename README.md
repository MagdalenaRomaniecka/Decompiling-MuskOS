### Project Goal
This project's goal was to create a visual linguistic profile of Elon Musk based on aggregated word frequency data. It aims to humorously and data-drivenly investigate whether his digital footprint paints a picture of a titan of innovation, a king of marketing, or perhaps just a man who really, really likes the word "yeah".

### Data Processing Workflow
This project shows an end-to-end data pipeline, transforming a large, raw dataset into a clean, analysis-ready format.

**1. Data Sourcing (The First File):**
Due to GitHub's file size limitations, the raw dataset (`all_musk_posts.csv`) is hosted externally on Google Drive.


**2. Data Cleaning & Aggregation (The Python Script):**
The Python script (available in the `/notebooks` folder) loads the raw data, cleans it, creates a `Year` feature from the `createdAt` column, searches for keywords, and aggregates the results to count the frequency of each term per year.

**3. Data Output (The Second File):**
The script generates a clean dataset named `wyniki_analizy_tweetow.csv` (available in the `/data` folder), which is the direct input for the visualization.

### Analysis and Conclusions

*(This analysis is based on the conclusions from the "elon 2" document)*

#### **The Main Pillar: "Tesla" â€“ From Startup to Giant**
It's no surprise that **"tesla"** is one of the most frequently used words. The chart shows clear spikes that correlate with key events in the company's history, such as the Model 3 "production hell" (2017-2018) and the explosive stock growth and Gigafactory openings (2020-2022). Musk uses Twitter as his primary channel to communicate progress and manage the brand's public image.

#### **The Public War: Musk vs. "Legacy Media"**
The phrase **"legacy media"** is a weapon in Musk's communication arsenal. Its usage sharply increases during periods when Musk or his companies are under fire, particularly during and after the acquisition of Twitter (X). By labeling critics as "old media," he discredits them in the eyes of his followers, creating an "us versus them" narrative.

#### **The Currency of Conversation: "Yeah," "True," "Exactly"**
These short, affirmative words are the foundation of his interaction style. Their consistently high frequency shows that he uses the platform for conversation, not just announcements. They serve to quickly build agreement, validate his supporters' viewpoints, and create an impression of direct, authentic dialogue, which functions as a powerful engagement mechanism.

#### **The Event Horizon: "Coming Soon" and "Next Year"**
Musk is a master of selling the future. These phrases create a constant sense of anticipation around his projects (FSD, Cybertruck, etc.). This linguistic tool helps sustain high valuations and public interest, which are often based more on his vision than on current results.

#### **Final Verdict: The Linguistic DNA of Elon Musk**
Elon Musk's language on social media is a precisely constructed system based on **promoting a vision**, **building a tribal identity**, and **maintaining engagement** through the appearance of direct dialogue. The data clearly shows that these are not random words, but a conscious and remarkably effective communication strategy.
